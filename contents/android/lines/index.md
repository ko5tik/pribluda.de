Logic and concentration game. Arrange color balls in straight lines of 5 
or more to remove them and earn points. New balls are placed on every turn. 
Game is open end - as long as you have space you can play

Tap the ball,  tap the place where you like it to go. On the next turn there will be 3 new balls (see preview colors on top). 
You can undo last move (see this arrow next to preview?).  Try to get  lines longer than 5 - there will be more points.  Hey, and lines can cross!

Beware: this is major time sink.
