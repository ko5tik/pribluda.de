I am freelance software developer and (what a wonder!) develop software for profit (have to pay my bills) and fun (when I get time to do it). I am open to 
projects in europe (preferably Rhine-Main area ot remote with sane amount of travel). My technology stack includes everything java, android and more recently 
javascript (and also older and exotic stuff). Manche Beiträge werden auch auf deutsch geschrieben - а иногда и  про русски.
